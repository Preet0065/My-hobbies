    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 26px" >Coding, sometimes called computer programming, <br> is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take,<br> and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code,<br> you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.<br> You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data,<br> and do lots of other cool things. Isn't it a great thing thats why I do coding!</p>

            <p style="font-size: 26px" >Television can help you feel less lonely. Psychologists coined the term <br> "social surrogacy"to explain how television can fill the shoes of absent friends or family.<br> In one study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,<br> researchers found that people who watch a favorite TV show report feeling less lonely during the show.<br>TV can expand your mind. Some shows let you travel vicariously and teach  <br>you about different people, cultures, ideas, and places you might never encounter in real life . Watching a variety of shows might give us a broader understanding of the world <br> we live in and expose us to things we might otherwise <br> never come across in our own lives.</p>
